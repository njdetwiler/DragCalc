# DragCalc
MATLAB - class project that calculates the total drag acting on an aircraft with given geometry

Normally, this would be done by using a series of functions in place of the long, dense portions of the script; but this made the script easier to see, work on/debug, and (probably) grade.

I do plan to go back to this project to add the ability for a user to input specific parameters and it will plot the curves described in the current iteration of the project. This would be done by changing the functions/calculations to permit arrays to be passed via a readf command and setting the script in a loop of length(array). The figure() function within the loop would have an input of the loop index (probably limited to a reasonable number of figures like 5?). In an even further revision, it may be put into a 3D plot for visibility purposes.
